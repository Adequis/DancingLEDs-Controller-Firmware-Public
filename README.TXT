The ble_OctoWS2811.ino file requires the nrf8001_arm_support_new, TimerThree, OctoWS2811 and SPI libraries to be installed.

nrf8001_arm_support_new has been updated to support Teensy SPI.

The TimerThree and SPI libraries may have been installed as part of the Arduino or Teensyduino installation, so make sure to replace them.  In Windows, libraries located under Program Files/Arduino/Libraries take precedence over libraries under My Documents/Arduino/Libraries.

Development occurs in Arduino 1.0.6 and Teensyduino 1.20.
